Just a couple of vegan gamers from the Midwest trying to live sustainably and healthy while helping others. We started this blog to share all of the things we are passionate about like vegan food, video games, sexual wellness, and more! We hope that by sharing a bit of our everyday life we can encourage others to make more informed and healthy decisions, for themselves and our planet.
