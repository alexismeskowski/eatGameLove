<h2>Hello friends, Kyle and I had a lot of fun streaming this week</h2>
<p>We recently decided to start making weekly highlights that will be uploaded every Saturday to the EatGameLove YouTube channel. This week included a mix of Breath of the Wild, some random switch games we played on Blackout Wednesday like Mario Party, Yoshi’s Wooly World, Mario Maker, and also our Thanksgiving stream.</p>
<p>If you’d like to catch our stream like you can go to <a href="twtich.tv/theeatgamelove" target="_blank">twitch.tv/theeatgamelove</a> and follow us. We stream every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8-10 PM CST.</p>
