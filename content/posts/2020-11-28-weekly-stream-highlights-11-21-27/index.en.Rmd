## Hello friends, Kyle and I had a lot of fun streaming this week

We recently decided to start making weekly  highlights that will be uploaded every Saturday to the EatGameLove YouTube channel. This week included a mix of Breath of the Wild, some random switch games we played on Blackout Wednesday like Mario Party, Yoshi's Wooly World, Mario Maker, and also our Thanksgiving stream.

If you'd like to catch our stream like you can go to [twitch.tv/theeatgamelove](twtich.tv/theeatgamelove){target="_blank"} and follow us. We stream every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8-10 PM CST.
