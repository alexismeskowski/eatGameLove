## Hello friends! Kyle and I were hungry for some cookies so we tried these ones. 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "LSFGrbgru2M&t")
```

### We are not affiliated with either brand that we talked about and I’m really sorry for getting the name and company of the beer wrong twice in a row, I was all mixed up.

- [Here](https://bcorporation.net/about-b-corps){target="_blank"} is information on what a B Certified Corporation is

- [Here](https://www.newbelgium.com/beer/voodoo-ranger-ipa){target="_blank"} is a link to the drink we had.

    - (pls don’t use this link if you aren’t 21+)

- [Here](https://munkpack.com/product/munk-pack-protein-cookies/){target="_blank"} is the link to these cookies we tried.

### We really liked the cookies and we would definitely buy them again if we come across them!
