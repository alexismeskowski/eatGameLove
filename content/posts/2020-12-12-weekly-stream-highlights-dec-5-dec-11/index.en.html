<h2>Hello friends, Lexi and I played some Super Mario 64 and Breath of the Wild this week!</h2>
<p>This week we tried out the new Super Mario 3D All-Stars. Lexi has yet to play Super Mario 64 so she was able to try it out! We will definitely be playing through all 3 Mario titles in 3D All-Stars. We played BotW for the majority of this week as we inch even closer to finishing this game! We also have a snippet from our dinner planning session (Mondays 10:00 PM CST) where we use <a href="https://koderkow.shinyapps.io/dinnR/" target="_blank">our own app</a> to plan our meals</p>
<p>If youâ€™d like to catch our stream like you can go to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theeatgamelove" target="_blank">twitch.tv/theeatgamelove</a> and follow us. We stream every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8-10 PM CST.</p>
