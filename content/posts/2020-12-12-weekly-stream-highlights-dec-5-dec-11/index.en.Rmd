## Hello friends, Lexi and I played some Super Mario 64 and Breath of the Wild this week!

This week we tried out the new Super Mario 3D All-Stars. Lexi has yet to play Super Mario 64 so she was able to try it out! We will definitely be playing through all 3 Mario titles in 3D All-Stars. We played BotW for the majority of this week as we inch even closer to finishing this game! We also have a snippet from our dinner planning session (Mondays 10:00 PM CST) where we use [our own app](https://koderkow.shinyapps.io/dinnR/){target="_blank"} to plan our meals

If you'd like to catch our stream like you can go to [twitch.tv/theeatgamelove](https://www.twitch.tv/theeatgamelove){target="_blank"} and follow us. We stream every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8-10 PM CST.
