### Notes:

- We prefer to make this in the air fryer so that the sweet potatoes get a little more crispy, but the oven works perfectly fine if you don't have an air fryer or you don't feel like pulling yours out!
- Kyle and I buy Nutzo at Costco in bulk and use it for a lot of things in the place of other nut butters such as putting it on toast, in porridge, or on the side with an apple. If you don't have it on hand or can't find it easily (I know I have seen it at Wal-Mart), any nut butter will work fine. 
- Play around with the spices you use, if cayenne is too hot, use paprika. Or maybe you have a favorite spice blend on hand that you would like to try. We're always changing it up to make things interesting, but this is the most basic way we make this recipe.
