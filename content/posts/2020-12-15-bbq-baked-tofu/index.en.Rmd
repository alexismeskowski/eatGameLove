## Hello friends, this recipe is one of our favorites from [Where You Get Your Protein](https://www.whereyougetyourprotein.com/){target="_blank"}!

You can find the recipe [here](https://www.whereyougetyourprotein.com/bbq-tofu-with-caramelized-onions/){target="_blank"}. We made this for the first time a few weeks ago and it has quickly become one of our favorite recipes. Because we didn't modify the recipe at all, we thought it would be a dick move to put the recipe on our website. Please go check out [Marlena's blog](https://www.whereyougetyourprotein.com/bbq-tofu-with-caramelized-onions/){target="_blank"} for it!

### Notes:

- We used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue sauce because that is our favorite
- Topping with avocado really made this recipe for us and we can't stop making it
