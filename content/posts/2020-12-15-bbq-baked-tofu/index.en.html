<h2>Hello friends, this recipe is one of our favorites from <a href="https://www.whereyougetyourprotein.com/" target="_blank">Where You Get Your Protein</a>!</h2>
<p>You can find the recipe <a href="https://www.whereyougetyourprotein.com/bbq-tofu-with-caramelized-onions/" target="_blank">here</a>. We made this for the first time a few weeks ago and it has quickly become one of our favorite recipes. Because we didn’t modify the recipe at all, we thought it would be a dick move to put the recipe on our website. Please go check out <a href="https://www.whereyougetyourprotein.com/bbq-tofu-with-caramelized-onions/" target="_blank">Marlena’s blog</a> for it!</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We used Sweet Baby Ray’s Honey Barbecue sauce because that is our favorite</li>
<li>Topping with avocado really made this recipe for us and we can’t stop making it</li>
