## Hello friends, we streamed a little bit of everything this week! :)

We started off the week making some [Crispy Kumara Cakes](https://quitegoodfood.co.nz/crispy-kumara-cakes/){target="_blank"} and then played some Guild Wars and a bit of Super Mario Sunshine. Kyle rounded off the week with a coding stream and I showed some of my code and video editing. 

### If anyone is interested in seeing how I edit these videos in DaVinci Resolve I would be glad to clip the parts of Saturdays stream where I go over it. <3
