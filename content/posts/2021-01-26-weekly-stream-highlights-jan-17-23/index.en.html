<h2>Hello friends, we streamed a little bit of everything this week! :)</h2>
<p>We started off the week making some <a href="https://quitegoodfood.co.nz/crispy-kumara-cakes/" target="_blank">Crispy Kumara Cakes</a> and then played some Guild Wars and a bit of Super Mario Sunshine. Kyle rounded off the week with a coding stream and I showed some of my code and video editing.</p>
