<h2>Hello friends, I completed my February 2021 bullet journal layout :)</h2>
<p>On Saturday I showed the process of creating my bullet journal layout from start to finish. I asked the discord and my twitter followers which colors I should use this month and purple won so I did an all purple layout. If you are interested in the finished project there are pictures underneath the video! I will be doing this every month from now on so if you are interested <strong>mark February 27th in your bullet journal because that is when I will be making the layout for March</strong>. See you then (;</p>
