### Notes:

- This can be made with any vegetables you have on hand especially the ones you need to get rid of
- Kyle and I buy a huge bag of carrots and chop it up all at once to store in the freezer. As we make meals like this one, we grab the already chopped frozen carrots and just throw them in the skillet. 
- Any vegan oil can be used to make this, but Kyle and I prefer to use a vegan butter such as [Myoko's](https://miyokos.com/collections/vegan-butter){target="_blank"} or [Earth Balance](https://earthbalancenatural.com/spreads/original-buttery-spread){target="_blank"}.
