### Notes:

- This can be made with any vegetables you have on hand especially the ones you need to get rid of
- If you have an instant pot you can use this to cook the rice quickly while you work over the wok
- Kyle and I buy a huge bag of carrots at Costco and chop it up all at once to store in the freezer. As we make meals like this one, we grab the already chopped frozen carrots and just throw them in the skillet, allowing the water to cook off them. 
- The tofu can be baked in the oven but Kyle and I prefer to use our air-fryer to get it nice and crispy quickly
- Any vegan oil can be used to make this, but Kyle and I prefer to use a vegan butter such as [Myoko's](https://miyokos.com/collections/vegan-butter){target="_blank"} or [Earth Balance](https://earthbalancenatural.com/spreads/original-buttery-spread){target="_blank"}.
