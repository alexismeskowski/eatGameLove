## Hello friends, this recipe is one of our favorites from [Choosing Chia](https://choosingchia.com/){target="_blank"}!

You can find the recipe [here](https://choosingchia.com/vegan-buffalo-cauliflower-mac-and-cheese/){target="_blank"}.  Because we didn't modify the recipe at all, we thought it would be a dick move to put the recipe on our website. Please go check out [Choosing Chia](https://choosingchia.com/vegan-buffalo-cauliflower-mac-and-cheese/){target="_blank"} for it!

Our friend **Stepford Husband** gave us a tip that you can use a ladle full of the leftover pasta water to thicken up the cheese sauce instead of adding cornstarch! So cool :)

Here is the link to his website you should go check him out because he is awesome:

### Notes:

- We add 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the chesse sauce when it's in the pan to make it thicker
- We add more nutritional yeast than Choosing Chia because we are cheesy fiends
- This recipe is included in the [dinnR app](https://koderkow.shinyapps.io/dinnR/){target="_blank"} that we made
