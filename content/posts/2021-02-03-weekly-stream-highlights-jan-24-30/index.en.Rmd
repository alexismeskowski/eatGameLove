## Hello friends, we had a lot of fun this week :)

We started off the week cooking one our favorite recipes: [BBQ Tofu w/ Onions](https://www.eatgamelove.com/2020-12-15-bbq-baked-tofu/){target="_blank"} and we almost burned our kitchen by leaving a pizza box in the preheating oven... Then we played some more Super Mario Sunshine, our friends started a bit war, and I ugly cried so thank you to all the friends that showed us love on Wednesday night. <3 We finished off the week by playing Stardew Valley with my little brother Josh and ended with Kyle and I dancing together at the Flower Dance, so it was a pretty fun week. :)
