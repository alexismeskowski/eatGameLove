<h2>Hello friends, we had a lot of fun this week :)</h2>
<p>We started off the week cooking one our favorite recipes: <a href="https://www.eatgamelove.com/2020-12-15-bbq-baked-tofu/" target="_blank">BBQ Tofu w/ Onions</a> and we almost burned our kitchen by leaving a pizza box in the preheating ovenâ€¦ Then we played some more Super Mario Sunshine, our friends started a bit war, and I ugly cried so thank you to all the friends that showed us love on Wednesday night. &lt;3 We finished off the week by playing Stardew Valley with my little brother Josh and ended with Kyle and I dancing together at the Flower Dance, so it was a pretty fun week. :)</p>
