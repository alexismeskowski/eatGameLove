1. Start a pan on medium heat and toss in a little olive oil
1. Chop onions and garlic, then add to the pan and cook until slightly translucent

1. Then ,add beans to the pan and saute that as well until cooked through
1. Add in a block of soft tofu and mash with a potato masher, crumble with your hands, or chop up with your cooking utensil.
1. Add taco seasoning and a splash of plant based milk and continue to stir a few more minutes until everything is incorporated into the “scramble”
1. Place “scramble” contents in the tortilla and top with your favorite toppings including the crispy potatoes if you so choose
1. Roll and enjoy :)
