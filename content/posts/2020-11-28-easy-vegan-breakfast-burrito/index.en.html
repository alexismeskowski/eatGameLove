<h2>Hello friends, here is one of our favorite vegan breakfast burrito recipes!</h2>
<p>We had a request to show how to cook with tofu, so we chose one of the easiest ways to use tofu, without even having to press it!</p>
<p><strong>We use mainly two types of tofu when we cook, the firmest (extra firm) and the softest (soft) kinds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The firmer kind is good for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>air frying to make it super crispy</p></li>
<li><p>baking in the oven with a marinade to make it super juicy</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The softer kind is good for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>blending up in soups or smoothies</p></li>
<li><p>mashing up in a pan to make a scramble</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>For our breakfast burrito we chose the softest and decided to make a scramble with it.</em></p>
<p>Because of this, there was no tofu press involved, however it is extremely simple to press tofu. Kyle and I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EZ-Tofu-Press-Removes-Texture/dp/B007LLGMG2/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=tofu+press&amp;qid=1606687990&amp;sr=8-6" target="_blank">this tofu press</a> off of Amazon and it works amazing. We simply put the block in between the two boards and twist the screws tighter, allowing it to drain over a bowl or container for about 20 minutes. It can help to twist the screws tighter every few minutes to get all the extra water out.</p>
<p>If you’d like to make your tofu really tasty you can marinade it very easily like in our <a href="https://www.eatgamelove.com/2020-11-01-tofu-fried-rice/" target="_blank">fried rice recipe</a> or this <a href="https://www.whereyougetyourprotein.com/bbq-tofu-with-caramelized-onions/#mv-creation-124-jtr" target="_blank">BBQ tofu recipe</a> that we love.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We bought some black bean patties from Costco that we don’t love, but this recipe helps us to get rid of them so we used that instead of some black beans</li>
<li>We would have added vegan cheddar but we didn’t have any on hand</li>
<li>Add any of your favorite veggies, toppings, or spices to this, the combinations are truly endless</li>
</ul>
