## Hello friends, Kyle and I played some more Breath of the Wild!

We recently decided to start making weekly  highlights that will be uploaded every Saturday to the EatGameLove YouTube channel. This week we played a ton of Breath of the Wild and even have a sneak peek of our dinner planning Monday nights at 10:30 PM CST!

If you'd like to catch our stream like you can go to [twitch.tv/theeatgamelove](https://www.twitch.tv/theeatgamelove){target="_blank"} and follow us. We stream every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8-10 PM CST.
